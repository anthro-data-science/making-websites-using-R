Hi everyone,

Just a reminder that this is coming up on Monday morning, and everyone is
welcome, no prior experience with websites or coding is necessary. In this
email we provide (1) some instructions to prepare for the workshop, (2) the
zoom details to join the meeting, and (3) resources for further reading
after the workshop.

# Instructions to prepare for the workshop

To ensure you have a smooth experience in the workshop, please download and
install both R and RStudio on your computer before the workshop starts.
This will ensure we can make good use of our time together. Here are
instructions and video tutorials to guide you with those steps, if you have
any questions please send us an email (bmarwick@uw.edu, dglass1@uw.edu).
Please also create a free account at https://app.netlify.com/signup, this
is needed for our final step of putting our website on the internet.

Windows: Install R by downloading and running this .exe file
<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm> from CRAN
<https://cran.r-project.org/index.html>. Also, please install the RStudio
IDE <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>. Note
that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the
installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as
administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur
later, for example when installing R packages. Please see this Video
Tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PjTAylwoU> for more details.

macOS: Install R by downloading and running this .pkg file
<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg> from CRAN
<https://cran.r-project.org/index.html>. Also, please install the RStudio
IDE <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>. Please
see this Video Tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ly3kyxwEg> for
more details.

Linux: You can download the binary files for your distribution from CRAN
<https://cran.r-project.org/index.html>. Or you can use your package
manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base and for
Fedora run sudo dnf install R). Also, please install the RStudio IDE
<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>.
